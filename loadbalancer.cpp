// ======================= TIME-TRAVEL DEBUGGER - LOAD BALANCER TEMPLATE =======================

// What load balancer does:
//   1. Many clients can connect at the same time. Each one sends one string (the source code). 
//   2. Clients wait in a queue (first come, first served).
//   3. For each client, in order: make sure the server is running (start it with system() if not),
//      pass the string to the server, pass the server's reply back to the client.
//
// It does not read or understand the messages. It only moves bytes.
// The only messages it writes itself are errors ("server busy", "server failed to start").
//
// Two threads:
//   acceptor thread (acceptLoop) -> takes new clients and puts them in the queue. It never waits for the server.
//   main thread (dispatcherLoop) -> takes ONE client out of the queue and serves it completely, then the next.
//
// How the server is started:
//   system("./server 5001 &");
//   The "&" is required. Without it, system() waits until the server exits and the load balancer freezes.
//
//
// What the server program must do (the load balancer depends on this):
//   - it takes its port as the first argument, for example: ./server 5001
//   - it reads the string until the connection's write side is closed (recv returns 0)
//   - it sends its reply as [status: 1 byte][payload], then closes the connection
